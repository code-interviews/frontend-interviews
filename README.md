# Front-end Developer Interview Handbook

## Introduction

This is an open source repository of questions, answers and concepts being exchanged at Front-end developer job interviews these days, neatly journaled by the contributors based on their personal experience. Along with an exhaustive quantity of content, it also focuses on neatly segregating and structuring them so that developers can directly jump to relevant sections.

## Why another repo?

It is true that there exists other repositories already which attempt to provide the most exhaustive set of materials and guide front-end developers to train themselves for job interviews. Yet no resource is entirely complete, some lack proper orientation of the syllabus while some do not provide satisfactory solutions to the problems. Consider this repo as another feather in the hat as we try to fill the gaps. 

**Note:** This repo does not claim to be a one-stop solution for the developers to go from zero to hero overnight. Most questions and answers are kept open-ended for discussions, and you are not required to memorize them verbatim to ace your next interview. It is a humble attempt by the developers, for the developers to improve their thought process :)
